    App Behavior
    </h2>

    <p>
    <b>This app is still prototypical!</b> 
    </p>

    <p>
    This app requires an input <code>AmpliconMatrix</code> with a column <code>AttributeMapping</code>
    containing the sample metadata to correlate amplicons' values against.
    If that <code>AmpliconMatrix</code> also has a row <code>AttributeMapping</code> containing taxonomy assignments,
    then pooling the amplicon matrix by a taxonomic rank can be done.
    In that case this app expects taxonomy with semicolon-delimited taxon names with 
    with missing ranks (e.g., <code>''</code>, <code>'unclassified'</code>, or truncated) allowed.
    To obtain suitable taxonomic assignments, the RDP Classifier app can be run. 
    </p>
